                    Between.
                    In the Lands Between ruled by Queen Marika the Eternal, the Elden Ring, the source of the
                    Erdtree,
                    has
                    been
                    shattered.
                    Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring known as the Great Runes,
                    and
                    the
                    mad
                    taint of their newfound strength triggered a war: The Shattering. A war that meant abandonment
                    by
                    the
                    Greater Will.
                    And now the guidance of grace will be brought to the Tarnished who were spurned by the grace of
                    gold
                    and
                    exiled from the Lands Between. Ye dead who yet live, your grace long lost, follow the path to
                    the
                    Lands
                    Between beyond the foggy sea to stand before the Elden Ring.
                    And become the <a href="mailto:ricardonsant@hotmail.com">Elden Lord</a>.</b></p>
